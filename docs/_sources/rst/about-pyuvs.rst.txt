About PyUVS
===========

PyUVS is one of the all time great Python codebases. It started when Kyle
dared to add in a unit test to a wholly untested instrumental pipeline and was
furthered due to Zac's ingenuity. It was also furthered by Justin's
unrivaled insight into the instrument performance.

This codebase largely synthesizes the ideas and calibration methodology from
team members into a singular location, along with adding tests and increased
readability.
