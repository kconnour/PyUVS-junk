## PyUVS 
PyUVS is a Python codebase for working with data from the Imaging
Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) instrument from the Mars Atmosphere and
Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission. It provides

* pyuvs: a library for working with these data products
* scripts for creating visualizations of apoapse data
* scripts for creating IUVS data and ancillary data (calibrated spectra,
  pixel geometry, etc.)

### Getting started
The best way to get started with PyUVS is to check out the documentation
(soon to be added here).
